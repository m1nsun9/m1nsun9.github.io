### Lagrange

Lagrange is a minimalist Jekyll blog theme that I built from scratch. The purpose of this theme is to provide a simple, clean, content-focused blogging platform for your personal site or blog.

Feel free to check out <a href="https://github.com/m1nsun9/" target="_blank">my GitHub page</a>, where you’ll find projects and data analysis activities I've learned.

### Jekyll Starter Kit

The Jekyll Starter Kit is a simple framework for starting your own Jekyll project using all of the best practices that I learned from building my other Jekyll themes.
